# Did you know?

🍓 August 20th 1969 was the last time that all four Beatles recorded together, they finished on ‘I Want You (She’s So Heavy’).

🍓 It took 129 days and 400 hours of studio time to record and complete Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. And how blessed 129 days these were.

🍓 Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band established the trend for artists to include their lyrics within the LP’s design. Trendsetter, huh?

🍓 The Beatles’ first album, Please Please Me, topped the UK charts for thirty weeks before being replaced by With The Beatles, which stayed there for 21 weeks.

🍓 The BBC banned I Am the Walrus because of the reference to ‘knickers’ in the lyrics. The BBC also banned Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Fixing a Hole and A Day in the Life because they decided they all referred to drugs.
